	<synopsis>It is predicted that there is a 70 percent possibility of an earthquake directly hitting Tokyo within the next 30 years. Are you prepared? The Tokyo Metropolitan Government has compiled a manual called Disaster Preparedness Tokyo (Tokyo Bousai) to help households get fully prepared for an earthquake directly hitting Tokyo and other various disasters. The manual includes a short manga, Tokyo X Day, to give Tokyo residents an idea of what to expect if a magnitude 7 earthquake hits. This original manga comic vividly describes how Tokyo would be like just before and immediately after a major earthquake. Imagine yourself in these situations and take actions to be prepared.</synopsis>
