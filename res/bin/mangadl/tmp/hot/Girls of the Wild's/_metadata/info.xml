	<synopsis>Wild's High has a 42-year history as a fighting specialized, girls only, private high school meant solely for the elite. It is also the place that Wild's-League is held: the most popular event in the country and the only place in the world where teenage girls have brutal fights with their lives on the line. One year the school changed from a girls only school to a mixed gender school. The only male student, Song Jae Gu, has been granted a full 3-year scholarship regardless of grades. Being someone who had to spend every moment either working or taking care of his younger brother and sister, he accepted. But after meeting Queen, the bloody champion of Wild's-League, drenching her in coffee, calling her a monster, and getting caught seeing her while she was taking a shower... his scholarship could prove fatal.
